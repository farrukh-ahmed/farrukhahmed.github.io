excerpt: 'Financial decisions are among the most significant
life-changing decisions that individuals make. There is a strong
correlation between financial decision making and human
behavior. In this research the relationship between what people
think and how stock market moves is investigated. The data from
2010 to 2015 of some of business, political and financial events
which directly impact the local stock market in Pakistan is
analyzed. The data was collected from search engine Google via
Google trends. The association between internet searches
regarding the political or business events and how the subsequent
stock market moves is established. It was found that increase in
search of these topics may lead to stock market fall or rise. The
overall objective of this research is to predict Karachi Stock
Exchange (now known as Pakistan stock exchange) 100 index by
quantifying the semantics of international market. In addition to
that, the relation between what an individual thinks while
searching on Google which affects the local market is also
investigated. The collected data has been mined by Multiclass
Neural Network and Multiclass Decision Trees. The result shows
that Multiclass Decision Trees performed best with an accuracy
of 94%.'
