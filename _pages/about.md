🎓 Hi there! I am a master's student at [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/) pursuing Data Science. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from [NEDUET](https://www.neduet.edu.pk/).

💻 After completing my undergrad, I worked in the industry as a Software Engineer in Pakistan and UAE. Currently, along with my master's, I am working as a Working Student Cloud Development at [Makonis](https://www.makonis.de/).

🔍 My research interests are in Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I have also started to explore GenAI to understand what the hype is about.

📊 Currently, I am working on my Master's Thesis in the area of Generalized Linear Models and Generative Additive Models under the supervision of [Prof. Dr Groll](https://bd.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/professur/arbeitsgruppe/prof-dr-andreas-groll/) and Prof. Dr. Kristen Schorning.


👨‍💼 Professional Experience
======
I'm an experienced Software Engineer with over five years of professional experience across multiple countries. I consider myself a full-stack developer, (though I'm not too keen on Frontend work🤫). My main expertise lies in Backend Development and working with Cloud technologies. Before moving to Germany, I worked at Etisalat as a third-party contractor, where I led the transformation of a legacy project, resulting in Etisalat saving five million AED annually. In Pakistan, I worked as a Software Engineer, handling both in-house and client-based projects. For more details about my professional journey, feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farrukhahmedqureshi/) or my [CV](https://farrukh-ahmed.github.io/me/files/Farrukh_Ahmed-CV.pdf) section.

🤸 Hobbies
======
🏋️‍♂️ I like to lift weights at least four times a week.

🏃 I enjoy hiking when the weather is good.
